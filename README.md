# Zuyd-LearningAnalytics-Dataecosystem
A data ecosystem enabling learning analytics for learning design developed for Zuyd University of Applied Science, ICT faculty. The goal of this application is to enable other systems to send their learning analytics data to a central location, and make this data available again through API's (for example for use in dashboards).
